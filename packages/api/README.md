# API for the App

The API app is hosted under

```
- digital-broker-app/packages/api
```

```
- Open the project in the terminal
- Run -> cd packages/api (make sure you are in the api folder on the terminal after running the command)
```

## Please follow the steps below in the same order (as build step is needed before an App can be run)

### Install

```
Pre-requisite: Node (This API has been tested against the node version v20.11.0)

npm install
```

### Build

```
npm run build
```

```

##### Running this will run the app on http://localhost:3000. Postman collection has been added for the POST route created. That can be imported and API can be run and tested.
